1. Introduction

This document outlines a test automation strategy for Fivetran Local Data Processing using Python and Pytest.
The plan covers unit, integration, functional, and performance tests, focusing on the following areas:

    Data reader
    Data transformer
    Data writer
    Database interaction (including DML and DDL operations)

2. Testing Frameworks and Tools

    Unit testing: pytest
    Integration testing: pytest
    Functional testing: pytest
    Performance testing: Locust
    Database interaction: psycopg2

3. Test Cases
3.1 Unit Tests

    Data reader:
        Verify that the data reader can correctly read data from the source location.
        Verify that the data reader can handle different data formats.
        Verify that the data reader can handle errors.
    Data transformer:
        Verify that the data transformer can correctly transform data according to the specified rules.
        Verify that the data transformer can handle different data types.
        Verify that the data transformer can handle errors.
    Data writer:
        Verify that the data writer can correctly write data to the target location.
        Verify that the data writer can handle different data formats.
        Verify that the data writer can handle errors.

3.2 Integration Tests

    Verify that the data reader, data transformer, and data writer can work together to process data correctly.
    Verify that the Fivetran Local Data Processing system can handle different types of data sources and target destinations.
    Verify that the Fivetran Local Data Processing system can handle errors.

3.3 Functional Tests

    Verify that the Fivetran Local Data Processing system can perform the following operations:
        Insert data into a database table.
        Update data in a database table.
        Delete data from a database table.
        Run SQL queries against a database.
    Verify that the Fivetran Local Data Processing system can handle different types of transactions.
    Verify that the Fivetran Local Data Processing system can handle errors.

3.4 Performance Tests

    Measure the performance of the Fivetran Local Data Processing system under different workloads.
    Identify any bottlenecks in the system.
    Optimize the system to improve performance.
